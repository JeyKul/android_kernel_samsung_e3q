    /* Interface to IPACM */
    /**
     * @TODO This will likely need to be extended into a proper FactoryPattern
     * when version bumps are needed.
     *
     * IPACM does not need to talk directly back to the returned HAL class.  The other methods that
     * IPACM needs to call are covered by registering the event listeners.  If IPACM did need to
     * talk directly back to the HAL object, without HAL registering a callback, these methods would
     * need to be defined in the HAL base class.
     *
     * This would slightly break backwards compatibility so it should be discouraged; however, the
     * base class could define a sane default implementation and not require that the child class
     * implement this new method.  This "sane default implementation" might only be possible in the
     * case of listening to async events; if IPACM needs to query something, then this would not
     * be backwards compatible and should be done via registering a callback so that IPACM knows
     * this version of HAL supports that functionality.
     *
     * The above statements assume that only one version of the HAL will be instantiated at a time.
     * Yet, it seems possible that a HAL_V1 and HAL_V2 service could both be registered, extending
     * support to both old and new client implementations.  It would be difficult to multiplex
     * information from both versions.  Additionally, IPACM would be responsible for instantiating
     * two HALs (makeIPAAIDL(1, ...); makeIPAAIDL(2, ...)) which makes signaling between HAL versions
     * (see next paragraph) slightly more difficult but not impossible.
     *
     * If concurrent versions of HAL are required, there will likely need to only be one master.
     * Whichever version of HAL receives a client first may be allowed to take over control while
     * other versions would be required to return failures (ETRYAGAIN: another version in use) until
     * that version of the client relinquishes control.  This should work seemlessly because we
     * currently have an assumption that only one client will be present in system image.
     * Logically, that client will have only a single version (or if it supports multiple, it will
     * always attempt the newest version of HAL before falling back) and therefore no version
     * collisions could possibly occur.
     *
     * Dislaimer:
     * ==========
     * Supporting multiple versions of an interface, in the same code base, at runtime, comes with a
     * significant carrying cost and overhead in the form of developer headaches.  This should not
     * be done lightly and should be extensively scoped before committing to the effort.
     *
     * Perhaps the notion of minor version could be introduced to bridge the gaps created above.
     * For example, 1.x and 1.y could be ran concurrently and supported from the same IPACM code.
     * Yet, a major version update, would not be backwards compatible.  This means that a 2.x HAL
     * could not linked into the same IPACM code base as a 1.x HAL.
